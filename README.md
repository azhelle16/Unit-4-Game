You will be given a random number at the start of the game.

There are four crystals to play with. By clicking on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to your score.

You win the game by matching your total score to the random number. Otherwise, you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.

The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.

Each time the game starts, the game will change the value of each crystal.
